# Adblock-Rules

Removing infinite scroll (think YouTube recommended) and other questionable html elements from the websites I use.

## Getting Started

clone the repo. cargo run. copy contents of `out/OUTPUT.txt` into whichever adblock you use.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SpicyRicecaker/adblock-rules.git
cd adblock-rules
cargo run
# copy contents of out/output.txt
# paste into the adblock rules of your adblocker
```
